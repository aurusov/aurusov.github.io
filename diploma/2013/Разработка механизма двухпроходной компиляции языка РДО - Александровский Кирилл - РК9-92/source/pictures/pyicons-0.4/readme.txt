Python icons - source 0.4

This is the icon set used by Python 2.5, with extras. Contents:

ICO        - ICO files for Windows XP.
ICO Vista  - Full ICO files including 256x256x32bpp compressed format for
             Windows Vista.
PNG        - All resolutions/colour depths in PNG format.
source.xar - Original Xara Xtreme/LX (xara.com) vector graphics source file.
icons.svgz - source.xar exported to standard compressed SVG format.
             Note that due to some features not being present in SVG, and the
             export process being currently quite poor, many of the effects
             needed to render the icons exactly will be missing, however this
             may be useful for further editing, for non-Xara users.

Changelog:

0.4 2006-06-03 and@doxdesk.com
    Removed white pixels with opacity below 0.5 from 32bpp icons, to avoid an
    obscure rendering bug in WinXP.
    Simplified the 4bpp icons.
    Removed 48x48x8bpp format from the main ICO files because it is rarely
    needed (only XP can use it, but XP can display the 16bpp version almost
    as well anyway).
0.3 2006-05-19 and@doxdesk.com
    Tweaks to shadows.
0.2 2006-04-14 and@doxdesk.com
    Added .egg icon.
    Tweak to .pyc corner.
    pycon text colour changed.
    Exported to SVG.
    Fixed bad-style use of file() constructor ;-)
0.1 2006-03-20 and@doxdesk.com
    First hack.
